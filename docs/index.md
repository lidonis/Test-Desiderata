## Understanding Test Desiderata

Test desiderata refers to essential principles ensuring your test suite is efficient and comprehensive.
These principles guide the creation of tests that are maintainable, readable, and valuable.


## Key Principles

### **Isolated**
Each test runs independently to avoid interference.
- **Benefit**: Accurate failure pinpointing simplifies debugging.
- **Trade-off**: Setup/teardown may increase execution time.
- **Best Practice**: Reset resources and global state between tests.

### **Composable**
Tests focus on individual components that combine seamlessly.
- **Benefit**: Minimizes number tests avoiding combinatorial growth.
- **Trade-off**: Increases initial complexity.
- **Best Practice**: Use modular code and dependency injection.

### **Deterministic**
Tests produce consistent results for the same inputs.
- **Benefit**: Reliable tests build confidence by ensuring consistent outcomes.
- **Trade-off**: Requires control over external factors like time or randomness.
- **Best Practice**: Use test doubles to isolate dependencies.


### **Fast**
Tests execute quickly to provide rapid feedback.
- **Benefit**: Rapid feedback accelerates development.
- **Trade-off**: May sacrifice thoroughness for speed.
- **Best Practice**: Optimize test setups and aim for millisecond execution.


### **Writable**
Tests are easy to write and maintain.
- **Benefit**: Encourages adoption and contribution to the test suite.
- **Trade-off**: Oversimplification risks inadequate coverage.
- **Best Practice**: Provide clear guidelines and use simple naming conventions.


### **Readable**
Tests are easy to understand at a glance.
- **Benefit**: Simplifies collaboration and onboarding.
- **Trade-off**: Requires effort to maintain clarity.
- **Best Practice**: Use descriptive names and clearly express test intent.


### **Behavioral**
Tests reflect the expected behavior of the system.
- **Benefit**: Aligns tests with user expectations.
- **Trade-off**: Needs thorough documentation of expected behavior.
- **Best Practice**: Define behaviors collaboratively with stakeholders.


### **Structure-Insensitive**
Tests remain valid despite internal code changes.
- **Benefit**: Ensures tests remain valid during refactors.
- **Trade-off**: Decoupling tests from implementation requires effort.
- **Best Practice**: Focus on public interfaces over internal details.


### **Automated**
Tests run automatically to ensure consistency.
- **Benefit**: Enables frequent, consistent execution.
- **Trade-off**: Automation setup demands upfront investment.
- **Best Practice**: Run automated tests via CI/CD pipelines.


### **Specific**
Tests pinpoint issues precisely for faster debugging.
- **Benefit**: Quickly identifies root causes of failures.
- **Trade-off**: Writing highly focused tests can be challenging.
- **Best Practice**: Break down functionalities and write precise assertions.


### **Predictive**
Tests mirror real-world behavior to ensure reliability.
- **Benefit**: Provides confidence in production behavior.
- **Trade-off**: Requires understanding of the production environment.
- **Best Practice**: Use real-world scenarios and data for test cases.


### **Inspiring**
Tests foster confidence in the system's quality.
- **Benefit**: Motivates quality-focused development practices.
- **Trade-off**: Meaningful tests may require extra creativity and effort.
- **Best Practice**: Share success metrics to highlight testing's value.


## Balancing Test Properties
Not every test must embody all properties. Sacrifices should be compensated by more valuable traits.
- **Complementary Properties**: Automated tests can enhance speed and accuracy.
- **Apparent Conflicts**: Composability can help achieve both speed and predictive accuracy.
