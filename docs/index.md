## Balancing Test Properties

Not every test must embody all properties. Sacrifices should be compensated by more valuable traits.
- **Complementary Properties**: Automated tests can enhance speed and accuracy.
- **Apparent Conflicts**: Composability can help achieve both speed and predictive accuracy.

## Conclusion

By understanding and applying these test desiderata principles, you can create a robust and effective test suite that balances various test properties. This will help you build confidence in your system's quality and foster a culture of quality-focused development.
