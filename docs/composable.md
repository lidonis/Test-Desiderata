## Definition
Composable tests are tests that focus on individual components and can be combined seamlessly to test larger systems.

## Why Composability Matters

### Scalability
Composable tests allow for testing complex systems by breaking them down into smaller, manageable components.

### Maintainability
Composable tests are easier to maintain and update as individual components evolve.

### Reusability
Composable tests can be reused across different parts of the system, reducing duplication and effort.

## Challenges of Composable Tests

### Initial Complexity
Designing composable tests requires careful planning and can introduce initial complexity.

### Dependency Management
Managing dependencies between components can be challenging and requires careful coordination.

## Best Practices for Composable Tests

### Use Modular Code
**Write modular code that can be tested independently and combined to test larger systems.**

- Break down the system into smaller, reusable components.
- Ensure that each component has a well-defined interface and behavior.

### Leverage Dependency Injection
**Use dependency injection to manage dependencies between components.**

- Inject dependencies explicitly to make them easier to test and manage.
- Avoid tight coupling between components to enhance testability.

### Test Components in Isolation
**Test individual components in isolation before combining them to test larger systems.**

- Use mocking and stubbing to simulate dependencies and isolate components.
- Ensure that each component behaves correctly before integrating it with other components.

## Practical Example
Composable tests can be implemented using various testing frameworks and tools. The key is to ensure that tests are modular and can be combined seamlessly to test larger systems.

## Common Pitfalls

### Over-Segmentation
**Avoid breaking down the system into overly small components that are difficult to manage and test.**

### Ignoring Integration Tests
**Do not overlook integration tests that validate the behavior of the system as a whole.**

## Conclusion
Composable tests are essential for testing complex systems effectively. By following best practices and focusing on modular code and dependency injection, teams can create scalable and maintainable composable tests.
