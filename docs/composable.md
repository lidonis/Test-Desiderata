# Composable Tests

## Definition
Composable tests are designed to evaluate individual components or aspects of a system independently, allowing these smaller tests to be combined into more complex scenarios.  
This approach ensures that tests are modular and reusable, minimizing redundancy while maximizing coverage.

## Why Composability Matters

### Reduces Redundancy
By testing components individually, composable tests avoid duplicating effort and reduce the total number of tests required.

**Example**: Instead of writing separate tests for every combination of a user’s role and permission, test roles and permissions independently, and then validate their interactions.

### Encourages Reusability
When components are tested in isolation, the same tests can be reused in various combinations or extended for more advanced cases.

**Example**: A test for a payment processor module can be reused across different payment flows, such as subscriptions or one-time purchases.

### Improves Maintainability
Composable tests are easier to maintain since each test targets a specific component or interaction. Changes to the system can be isolated to the affected tests, reducing the impact of modifications.

**Example**: If a database query method changes, only the tests for that method need adjustment, not all tests that use the database.

### Enables Faster Debugging
When a test fails, isolating the failure to a specific component or interaction simplifies debugging.

**Example**: If a failure occurs in a test combining multiple modules, the composable structure allows identifying which module caused the issue.

## Challenges of Composable Tests

### Requires Modular Code
Composability depends on the system’s design. Highly coupled or monolithic systems can make it difficult to isolate and compose tests effectively.

### Initial Complexity
Designing tests with composability in mind requires planning and forethought, which can increase the initial effort.

### Risk of Missing Context
Focusing on isolated components might overlook context-dependent behaviors or emergent issues when components interact in unexpected ways.

## Best Practices for Composable Tests

### Focus on Component Boundaries
Design tests around well-defined boundaries to ensure each component’s behavior is tested independently.

**Example**: Test a logging service as an isolated unit rather than as part of a larger application flow.

### Use Mocks and Stubs
Replace dependencies with mocks or stubs to simulate interactions and isolate the component under test.

**Example**: Use a mock email service to verify that an email is sent without relying on an external SMTP server.

### Modularize Test Code
Organize tests so that common setup logic, shared data, and reusable utilities are easily accessible.

**Example**: Define reusable functions or fixtures for common test data like user profiles or product configurations.

### Parameterize Tests
Write parameterized tests to handle different inputs or configurations for the same component, avoiding combinatorial explosion.

**Example**: Test a pricing module with various discount rates or tax calculations by iterating over a set of predefined parameters.

### Validate Composed Scenarios
While individual components are tested in isolation, also test combinations of components to validate interactions and identify integration issues.

**Example**: After testing the authentication and payment modules separately, create tests for the checkout process where these modules interact.

## Additional Benefit: Scalability
Composable tests support scalable testing practices by breaking complex scenarios into manageable pieces, making it easier to expand the test suite as the system grows.

**Example**: Add tests for new modules incrementally without needing to rewrite existing tests or overhaul the structure.

## Conclusion
Composable tests provide a powerful framework for creating modular, reusable, and maintainable test suites.  
While the initial setup may require careful planning and system modularization, the long-term benefits include reduced redundancy, faster debugging, and easier maintenance.  
By adopting composable testing practices, teams can efficiently cover complex systems and ensure robust, scalable test coverage.
