## Definition

Inspiring tests are tests that foster confidence in the system's quality and motivate quality-focused development practices.

## Part of a Larger Framework

**Emily Bache's Perspective**: In Test Desiderata 2.0, Bache argues that "Inspiring" is not a separate macro property, but rather an outcome of achieving **Predict Success in Production**. If tests accurately predict production behavior, they naturally inspire confidence. If they don't, no amount of other properties will make them inspiring.

Therefore, inspiring tests emerge from combining predictive tests with other quality properties:

**Related Properties**:
- [Predictive](predictive.md) - The foundation of inspiring confidence
- [Behavioral](behavioral.md) - Tests that reflect expected behavior inspire trust
- [Deterministic](deterministic.md) - Reliable, consistent tests build confidence
- [Automated](automated.md) - Frequent, automated execution reinforces confidence

## Why Inspiration Matters

### Motivation
Inspiring tests motivate developers to write high-quality code and focus on testing.

### Confidence
Inspiring tests build confidence in the system's quality by providing reliable and meaningful feedback.

### Culture
Inspiring tests foster a culture of quality-focused development and continuous improvement.

## Challenges of Inspiring Tests

### Creativity
Designing inspiring tests requires creativity and effort to make them meaningful and engaging.

### Maintenance
Inspiring tests need to be maintained and updated to ensure they remain relevant and motivating.

## Best Practices for Inspiring Tests

### Share Success Metrics
**Share success metrics and test results to highlight the value of testing and motivate developers.**

- Use dashboards and reports to showcase test coverage, pass rates, and other key metrics.
- Celebrate testing achievements and milestones to foster a positive testing culture.

### Make Tests Meaningful
**Ensure that tests are meaningful and provide valuable feedback to developers.**

- Write tests that cover real-world scenarios and edge cases.
- Provide clear and actionable feedback when tests fail.

### Foster Collaboration
**Foster collaboration between developers, testers, and other stakeholders to create inspiring tests.**

- Involve stakeholders in the testing process to ensure tests align with their expectations and needs.
- Encourage open communication and feedback to improve tests continuously.

## Practical Example
Inspiring tests can be created using various testing frameworks and tools. The key is to ensure that tests are meaningful, engaging, and motivate quality-focused development practices.

## Common Pitfalls

### Over-Focusing on Metrics
**Avoid over-focusing on metrics at the expense of meaningful and engaging tests.**

### Ignoring Feedback
**Do not ignore feedback from developers and stakeholders. Use their input to improve tests continuously.**

## Conclusion

Inspiring tests are crucial for fostering a culture of quality-focused development. By following best practices and focusing on meaningful and engaging tests, teams can create inspiring tests that motivate developers and build confidence in the system's quality.
